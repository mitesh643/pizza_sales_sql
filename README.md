In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of pizza sales data to identify key trends and insights. Using SQL queries, I explored various aspects of the data, such as order volume, revenue generation, pizza preferences, time-based order trends, and category contributions. The goal was to uncover patterns that can help improve sales strategies, optimize menu offerings, and enhance customer experience.

Scenario:
You work in data analysis for a pizza restaurant, and your task is to answer the following questions for the company:

How many total orders have been placed?
What is the total revenue generated from pizza sales?
Which pizza has the highest price?
What is the most commonly ordered pizza size?
What are the top 5 most ordered pizza types?
What is the total quantity of each pizza category ordered?
What time of day do customers place the most orders?
What is the category-wise distribution of pizzas?
What is the average number of pizzas ordered per day?
Which pizza types generate the highest revenue?
What is the percentage contribution of each pizza category to total revenue?
How has cumulative revenue grown over time?
Key Insights:
Total Orders: The restaurant received a significant number of orders, highlighting customer demand.
Total Sales Revenue: The analysis revealed total revenue, helping assess profitability.
Most Expensive Pizza: The highest-priced pizza was identified, providing insights into premium offerings.
Popular Pizza Size: The most commonly ordered pizza size was determined, helping with inventory planning.
Top-Selling Pizza Types: The five most frequently ordered pizzas were identified based on order quantity.
Category-Wise Demand: Pizza categories (e.g., vegetarian, non-vegetarian, specialty) were analyzed to see which had the highest sales.
Peak Ordering Hours: A time-based order distribution analysis identified peak business hours.
Revenue Distribution: Each pizza categoryâ€™s percentage contribution to total revenue was calculated.
Cumulative Revenue Growth: The cumulative revenue trend provided insights into overall business performance.
Technologies Used:
SQL Queries: Data extraction and manipulation using complex queries
Data Analysis Techniques: Aggregations, joins, sorting, filtering, and window functions
Data Visualization (Optional): Potential use of Power BI, Tableau, or Python for visual representation
Conclusion:
This analysis provided valuable insights into customer ordering patterns, pizza preferences, and revenue distribution. The findings can help optimize menu pricing, inventory management, and marketing strategies. Understanding peak order times and best-selling items can improve operations, while category-wise revenue breakdowns can guide future product offerings.

The project demonstrates how SQL-based data analysis can provide actionable insights for business growth and decision-making in the food industry.
